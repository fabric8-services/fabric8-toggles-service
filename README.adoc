== Overview

The fabric8-toggles-service is the client service to run with the link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles/[fabric8-toggles] server.
The server is heavily based on link:https://github.com/Unleash/unleash[Unleash server], a *feature toggle system*, that gives you a great overview over all feature toggles across all your applications and services.
It comes with official client implementations for Java, Node.js and Go.

fabric8-server defines 4 level of toggle configuration: `internal`, `experimental`, `beta` or `released`.
The activation strategy is per userGroupId.

Using the admin console deployed with fabric8-toggle, you can easily
move a feature from `experimental` to `beta`.
This client makes use of the unleash Go SDK to connect to fabric8-toggles server.

You can see usage of the service in link:https://github.com/fabric8-ui/fabric8-ui[fabric8-ui].

== Development

=== Build

The following guide is mainly targeted towards a Linux or macOS development
machine.

==== Pre-requisites

Have the following installed on your machine:

`go` Install link:https://golang.org/dl/[GoLang from 1.8+], set the environment variable `GOPATH`.

==== Get the code

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles-services $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles-service
```

==== Build

To fetch the Go dependencies, generate code (link:https://github.com/goadesign/goa[GOA framework]) and finally build the project you can
type:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles-service
$ make clean build
----

==== Run test

To run unit tests:
```
make build test
```

=== Docker build

* build image from centos

```
make image
```

* run your docker image in minishift
```
make deploy-minishift
```

* Deploy locally:

```
F8_TOGGLES_URL=http://toggles-fabric8.192.168.64.4.xip.io/api F8_AUTH_URL=https://auth.prod-preview.openshift.io make run
```
where `F8_TOGGLES_URL` points to the exposed route on minishift and `F8_AUTH_URL` target prod-preview.

=== Configure

==== Configure unleash database

* Go to fabric8-toggles-server admin console (ie: the unleash admin console) http://fabric8-toggles-fabric8.MINISHIFT_IP.nip.io
* In strategy tab:
  ** add a strategy with name `enableByLevel` with a parameter `level`, choose `string` for parameter type.
  ** add a strategy with name `enableByEmails` with a parameter `emails`, choose `list` for parameter type.
* Go to features list:
  ** add a feature with name "Planner", give a description and add the newly created `enableByLevel` strategy, enter `released`.
  ** add a feature with name `Analyze`, give a description and add the newly created `enableByEmails` strategy, enter your prod-preview and prod emails.
for `level`. Enable the feature.

[NOTE]
This is a temporary settings, the fabric8-server should bootstrap those values.

==== Test your service locally with a curl

* For anonymous user

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/features?names\=Planner
{
  "data": [
    {
      "attributes": {
        "description": "Planner's description",
        "enabled": true,
        "enablement-level": "released",
        "user-enabled": true
      },
      "id": "Planner",
      "type": "features"
    }
  ]
}
```

* For logged-in user

```
$ export TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/features\?group\=Analyze -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

=== 3scale

* Step 1: Register to https://www.3scale.net/signup/ (90-days trial - limited!)
* Step 2: Import your API in 3scaleDashboard (link:https://corinne-admin.3scale.net/apiconfig/services/2555417758260/integration/edit[corinne-admin])
* Step 3: APICast hosted meaning the public 3scale URl point to a hosted location (for trial only): https://api-2445582552398.staging.gw.apicast.io:443/toggles/api
* Step 4: Choose API-key (the other options are: app_id/app_key or oauth2), add it to f8-toggles-service
* Ready to go...
** Run the server with F8_TOGGLES_URL pointing to 3scale public API.
```
F8_TOGGLES_URL=https://api-2445582552398.staging.gw.apicast.io:443/toggles/api F8_USER_KEY="XXXXX" F8_AUTH_URL=https://auth.openshift.io make deploy-minishift
```

** Curl
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/features\?group\=Analyze -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
