== Overview

The fabric8-toggles-service is the client service to run with the link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles/[fabric8-toggles] server.
The server is heavily based on link:https://github.com/Unleash/unleash[Unleash server], a *feature toggle system*, that gives you a great overview over all feature toggles across all your applications and services.
It comes with official client implementations for Java, Node.js and Go.

fabric8-server defines 4 level of toggle configuration: `internal`, `experimental`, `beta` or `released`.
The activation strategy is per userGroupId.

Using the admin console deployed with fabric8-toggle, you can easily
move a feature from `experimental` to `beta`.
This client makes use of the unleash Go SDK to connect to fabric8-toggles server.

You can see usage of the service in link:https://github.com/fabric8-ui/fabric8-ui[fabric8-ui].
